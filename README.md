# Electrical Circuit Analysis with Python

Welcome to the **Electrical Circuit Analysis** repository! This project is dedicated to the study and analysis of electrical circuits using the Python programming language.

## 🛠️ About the Project

This repository aims to provide tools, scripts, and methodologies for:
- Simulating electrical circuits.
- Analyzing circuit behavior (e.g., voltage, current, power).
- Solving circuit equations (Kirchhoff's laws, node/mesh analysis).
- Visualizing circuit performance through graphs and data plots.

The repository is being developed to assist students, engineers, and enthusiasts in understanding and solving electrical circuit problems effectively with Python.

## 🚧 Status: Under Development

Please note that this repository is currently **in development**, and new features, examples, and documentation are being added progressively. Contributions and suggestions are welcome to help improve the project!

## 📋 Requirements

To get started, you'll need the following:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Common Python libraries such as:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`

Additional libraries or dependencies will be detailed in the respective script files.
